Annotation Sniffer
==================

Annotation Sniffer is a tool that extracts code annotation metrics from java source code. 

### How to download

Download the source code and generate an executable jar file. Or download the jar file provided with the latest release.

```
mvn clean install
```
### How to use

```
java -jar asniffer.jar <path to project> <path to xml report> <single/multi>
```

The "path to project" is mandatory, and should be the path to the java project to be analyzed (i.e, contains the source code files). Considering that only one java project is being analyzed, the directory should have the arrangement below.

    .
    ├── project                # Directory containing the source file for the project. This is the path provided

In this case the ASniffer will consider that every ```.java``` file inside the directory ```project``` belongs to the same project.

The ASniffer can also analyze multiple projects at once. In this case, the user should provide a directory with the arrangement described below.

    .
    ├── projects                # Root directory for projects. This is the path to be provided
        ├── project1            # Contains the source files for project1
        ├── project2            # Contains the source files for project2
        └── ...         

In this case the directory ```projects``` is a root folder, and the sub-directories ```project1```, ```project2``` and so forth, are each different java projects. They can be completely different projects. The user should manually arrange their projects directories to fit the arrangement described above, in order to use this ASniffer feature.

The second parameter, "path to xml", is optional. It tells the ASniffer where to store the XML report file. If no path is provided, the ASniffer will place the report in the "path to project". This parameter is a path to a directoy and should not include any ```.xml``` in its name. The XML file will be generated by the ASniffer, with the projects name being the name of the XML file, i.e., ```projectsName.xml```. The ASniffer assumes that the name of the root directory is the name of the project. In the case several projects are being analyzed, the ASniffer considers that each sub-directory (inside the provided root directory) is the name of a separate project, and each project will have its own XML report placed in the "path to xml" (if provided, or in the "path to project" otherwise).

The third parameter (single/multi) informs the ASniffer if the "path to project" contains only one project (i.e, every ```.java``` file belongs to only one project) or several projects (i.e, the root directory contains several sub-directories, with each being a separate project).


### Example Usage

As a running example we will collect annotation metrics from the ASniffer code itself. Consider that both the ```asniffer.jar``` and the ```asniffer``` directory with the source code are on the same root directory. We have the following directory structure.

    .
    ├── Documents                
        ├── asniffer.jar         # The ASniffer jar file. Can be manually generated or downloaded from the release section
        ├── asniffer/            # The ASniffer project folder, downloaded from its GitHub repository   

To run the tool, we use the following command:

```
java -jar asniffer.jar asniffer single
```

Notice that only two arguments are being passed, ```asniffer``` and ```single```. The first one is the path to the source code being analyzed, and the second one informs the ASniffer that this is a single project, i.e., every ```.java``` file inside the directory ```asniffer/``` belongs to one project, i.e., the asniffer project. Since no XML path was provided, the XML report will be placed under ```asniffer/``` with the name ```asniffer.xml```. 

After executing the command, the ```asniffer.xml``` was generated and placed under ```asniffer/```. The following is a sample of the ```asniffer``` directory.  

    .
    ├── asniffer                
        ├── asniffer.xml   # The XML report generated after the ASniffer collected metrics from the ASniffer project
        ├── src            # The source code folder 
        ├── pom.xml        # The pom file 
        └── ... 

The generated XML can be found in the repository, under [annotationtest/asniffer.xml](https://github.com/phillima/asniffer/blob/master/annotationtest/asniffer.xml)

Here is a sample of this XML file.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<project name="asniffer">
    <package name="annotationtest">
        <class name="annotationtest.AnnotationTest" type="class">

                        <annotation-metrics>
                            <item metric="AA" value="3"/>
                            <item metric="LOCAD" value="1"/>
                            <item metric="ANL" value="0"/>
                        </annotation-metrics>
                    </annotation>
...
```



Annotation Metrics
==================

The Annotations Sniffer was developed to aid research in code annotations analysis. It collects 9 annotation metrics. These metrics were proposed and defined in the the paper [A Metrics Suite for Code Annoation Assessment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016412121730273X)

### Collected metrics

* AC: Annotations in Class
* UAC: Unique Annotations in Class
* ASC: Annotation Schema in Class
* AED: Annotation in Element Declaration
* AA: Attributes in Annotation
* ANL: Annotation Nesting Level
* LOCAD: LOC in Annotation Declaration
* NEC: Number of Elements in Class
* NAEC: Number of Annotated Elements in Class

### XML Output Format

* Class Metrics: These metrics have one value per class, they are AC, UAC, ASC, NAEC and NEC
* Code Element Metrics: These metrics have one value per code element (method, field, enum, type). Our suite has one metric, AED (Annotations in Element Declaration), that measures the number of annotations declared in any given code element.
* Annotation Metrics: These metrics have one value values per annotation declared in the class. They evaluate the annotation itself (AA, LOCAD, ANL). 

* For each code element, the report contains the element name, type (field, method, enum, etc), the source code line where the element is located and "code element metric values" (for now, only AED fits this category)
* If the AED is greater than zero, then the code element contains annotations, and so the "annotation metrics" values printed on the XML. The report has the annotation name,source-code line and the values for AA, ANL and LOCAD.
                   
* In case of multiple projects, one XML file is generated for each one of them

* Following is an example of an XML report

```
<project name="project1">
    <package name="pacakge1">
        <class name="pacakge1.Class1" type="class">
            <schema>java.lang</schema>
            <schema>javax.persistence</schema>
            ...
            <metric name="LOC" value="50"/>
            <metric name="ASC" value="5"/>
            <metric name="AC" value="28"/>
            <metric name="NAEC" value="16"/>
            <metric name="UAC" value="18"/>
            <metric name="NEC" value="32"/>
            <code-elements>
                <code-element name="method1" type="method" code-line="20" aed="1"/>
                    <annotation name="Override" code-line="201" schema="java.lang">
                        <annotation-metrics>
                            <item metric="AA" value="0"/>
                            <item metric="LOCAD" value="1"/>
                            <item metric="ANL" value="0"/>
                        </annotation-metrics>
                    </annotation>
                </code-element>
            ...
            </codelements>
        ...
        </class>
    ...
    </package>
...
</project>  

```

### Creating a new Metric for Annotation Sniffer

The Annotation Sniffer uses Reflection to know which metrics it should collect. If you wish to use Annotation Sniffer on your project and create you owrn custom metrics, follow these steps:

* Class Metrics: If you wish to create your own Metric Class, your class must:
    - Extend ASTVisitor (to visit the compilation unit)
    - Implement the ```IClassMetricCollector```interface. It contains two methods, ```execute(CompilationUnit, MetricResult, AMReport)``` and ```setResult(MetricResult)```. The ```MetricResult``` class is where you want to store your value, as well as the name of your custom metric. Check the code for AC, ASC and UAC for examplee
    - Annotate the class with ```@ClassMetric```.


* If you wish to create new Annotation Metrics, then you need to:
    - Annotate the class with @AnnotationMetric.
    - Implement the interface ```IAnnotationMetricCollector```. This interface has only one method, ```execute(CompilationUnit, AnnotationMetricModel, Annotation)```. The ```AnnotionMetricModel``` class is where you will store the metric value and name. The ```Annotation``` class is the JDT (Java Development Tools) representation of the annotation that you can perform your analysis. Check the code for: ANL, AA and LOCAD for more examples.

* Check the metrics included in the package br.inpe.cap.asniffer.metric for more information.

ASniffer API
============

If you wish to use the ASniffer as an API on your own projects, we provide some methods for this. The first thing you need is an instance of the ```Runner``` class, passing to its constructor two parameters: A path to the source code to be analyzed and the path to where you wish to store the XML file. Afterwards you may call ```collectSingle()``` or ```collectMultiple()```.

```java
 
 String pathToCode = "path to the source code to by analyzed";
 String pathToXML = "path to where you wish to store the generated XML report";

 Runner runner = new Runner(pathToCode, pathToXML);
 
 runner.collectSingle(); //for a single project
 
 runner.collectMultiple(); //for multiple projects. It will run considering the directory structure is prepared for
                           //multiple projects, as described in the "How to Use" section on this Readme.
 
```

With these calls, the ASniffer will run, collect the annotation metrics, and place the XML report file on the provided path. However, if you would like to perform some analysis on the metrics values, both ```collectSingle()``` and ```collectMultiple()``` return, respectively, an instance of ```AMReport``` and a ```List<AMReport>```. The ```AMReport``` class contains the complete report of the collected metrics for each Java project. For this reason the ```collectMultiple()``` returns a list of ```AMReports``` (one for each Java project). 

The ```AMReport``` (located [here](https://github.com/phillima/asniffer/blob/master/src/main/java/br/inpe/cap/asniffer/model/AMReport.java)) contains the project's name, and the list of packages. The packages are stored in the ```PackageModel``` class, which in turn contains the ```MetricResult``` class that stores the annotation metrics values.

The following example collects the annotation metrics on multiple projects, prints their name and the name of every package.

```java

 List<AMReport> reports;
 String path = "projects";

 Runner runner = new Runner(path, path);
 reports = runner.collectMultiple();

 for (AMReport amReport : reports) {
  System.out.println(amReport.getProjectName());
  for (PackageModel packages : amReport.getPackages()) 
  	System.out.println(packages.getPackageName());
 }

```
